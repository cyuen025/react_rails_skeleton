Followed the tutorial

http://ttrmw.co.uk/code/rails_and_react_with_npm_modules.html


noted that:
"**If you are using react-rails or experience any issues with browiserfy-rails 2.x, please use the 1.5.x versions until 2.x is stabilized. Please see the issues for discussions and feel free to post your experience. The use of react-rails with browserify-rails is a bit of an anti-pattern in terms of going to CommonJS so it may never be supported. Consider using a browserify transform for React support."

I've decided to use
npm v3.5.3 (Was 2.x before)
node v4.2.4

npm v3.x seemed to solve this problem, while no other method helped
also added node_modules to the repo

Using weird syntax in components, since arrow functions seems not working with babel v6
